# Overview

This is a copy of the [Micropolis](https://github.com/SimHacker/micropolis) project with adaptations for a classroom setting.

# Instructions

1. clone the repository
2. open it in [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). If you have a strong preference for another IDE or wish to use pure command-line Java, that is fine as well. I will teach with IntelliJ in class.
3. Run the "Micropolis" run configuration
4. Build your city to 30,000 residents
